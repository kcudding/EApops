# EApops

Here's a workflow example using some analysis of the EAS survey data to estimate EA community growth rates. The main test features are 
1. the use of webshot to create images of tables that can be used for posting to EA forum, and
2. using github issues or discussion to track co-author, or even wider group comments
3. storing images for use in EAforum posts in our on repos
